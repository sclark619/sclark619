    <h2>I am a Graphic Designer!!!</h2>
    <p>I have been artistic for the most part of my life. I started drawing at about 8 years old, we then recieved our very 1st computer when I was 11 years old. I couldn't wait to get home to make power point presentations everyday after school. I would create and edit slide shows to show my family after we ate dinner.</p><br>
    When I was a softmore in high school I elected to take Information Techonology (IT) for my vocation. I receieved the Ambassador's Award my Junior year for having the highest grade in my grade level in my vocation. I now own my own design company and am looking to expand into all areas of web design and media design.
    I have designed logos and business cards for people in my local area including my own. Expanding my knowledge is the key to my success.
